# 徐卫雅思写作笔记 第一课

决定分数的因素：能力7、预测2、运气1

分数算法：大作文2/3、小作文1/3

大作文学好了就是英语学好了，小作文自然就会好

小作文就等于看图说话

考官给分，取平均值：
* TR: Task Response ：任务完成情况
* CC: Coherence and Cohesion ：衔接与连贯
* LR: Lexical Resource ：词汇资源
* GRA: Grammatical Range and Accuracy ：语法多样性和准确性

前两项是思路问题，后两项是英语表达的问题

审题思路不难，难的是词汇语法，心里的想法用英语写不好，有错

造句不好很大程度上是因为造句凭感觉，什么词汇拿过来凭感觉随便造句

学完之后造句要变得精确，自己要能判断句子是对是错

备考安排
* 一阶段：写作词汇、造句练习、语法练习
* 二阶段：中英文素材练习+仿写
* 三阶段：不限时写作练习
* 四阶段：模考

题型
1. Discuss advantages and disadvantages. Do you think the benefits outweigh drawbacks? Is it a positive or negative development?
2. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
3. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
4. What are reasons, effects and solutions?
5. What? How?

前三种占75%以上

分段：4段 vs 5段

* 4段双边论证：开头、好处、弊端、结论
  * 好处的素材多比较好写时用两端写好处，就是5段
* 4段单边论证：开头、好处、好处、结论

不担心考到没复习的话题，沉下心写十几个话题，后面自然就会写了，写来写去就会用自己最熟悉的，是一个融会贯通的过程。
写教育话题会用很多社会话题的词汇，写科技话题会用很多生活话题的词汇。
各种话题都复习一下就全部会写了。

写作步骤
1. 审题，标记题目关键词，分清楚题型，最多5分钟
2. 头脑风暴想观点(类似的观点可以合并同类项)
3. 确定总论点和个人倾向
4. 写文章
5. 写完检查一下，修改明显的错误

## 开头怎么写

题1: People these days can buy various goods on the internet Do you think the benefits of online shopping outweigh its drawbacks? 2017-11-11

**开头写两句话，一句写背景一句写观点**

### 头脑风暴想观点

* 好处：不用出门，节约时间，方便买到其他地方的产品，选择多，便宜，省钱，货比三家
* 弊端：假货，实物不得没法试穿，过度消费，剁手，冲动购物

### 开头第一句，背景

换词，切换主语，句子扩展和延长

#### 换词

* People 换 Citizen:
* these days 换 in this day and age
* buy 换 perchase

#### 换主语：People能做主语还有谁可以做主语？主语换了句子自然就变了，不需要刻意背句型

* Various goods： Various goods are available for purchase on the web
* The internet： The internet makes it possible for people to
* Online shopping： Online shopping has become increasingly popular
* It is common： It is common for people to
* 还想变长？并一下：Online shopping has become increasingly popular and Various goods are available for purchase on the web

#### 原因，结果，目的，对比，举例

* 上面的并列句Online shopping has become increasingly popular and Various goods are available for purchase on the web 这两个就有因果关系
* 往前扩展：**由于**网络的出现，现在网购越来越受欢迎：
  * **As a result of** the popularization of online shopping, a large variety of goods are available for purchase on the web.
* 往后扩展：现在网购越来越受欢迎，**于是**刺激消费：
  * 刺激消费不会写？写结果：销量飙升
  * Online shopping is becoming increasingly popular among consumers of various age groups, **with** total sales soaring every year.
  * 介词帮你延长句子：among、of、with
  * 换个容易的介词： Online shopping is becoming increasingly popular among consumers of various age groups, and total sales soar every year.
  * soar也不会？： Online shopping is becoming increasingly popular among consumers of various age groups, and total sales increase every year.
* 写容易的，少犯错也能6.5
  * It is common for people to buy goods on the web due to the development of the internet.
* 举例式：
  * Consumers can buy a large variety of goods **such as** foods, clothes and home appliances on the web to meet their daily demand
* 对比式
  * 之前去商店，后来上网
  * Traditionally, consumers need to go to stores to buy goods, but today this has changed, with more and more people choosing to shop on the internet.

不同题目不同写法好写，随便选一个合适的

#### 从句，并列，介词短语，动词不定式

#### 练习

题2： In some countries, more and more adults choose to continue living with their parents after they graduate and find jobs. Do you think the benefits outweigh its drawbacks(2015-4-30)

* 头脑风暴想观点
  * 好处:减少生活压力，省钱，省房租，年轻人可支配收入增加;照顾父母，联系紧密
  * 弊端:依赖，不独立，没有隐私，代沟，生活习惯不同，矛盾
* 写开头，背景+观点
  * 换主语
    * It is common for young people in many countries to live with their parents after they leave school and find jobs.
  * 原因
    * To 为了减轻生活压力，reduce pressure：
    * Due to 房价太高： Due to the high price of housing, many young people choose to live with their parents, even after they have found jobs.
  * 对比
    * Traditionally, young people would leave their home after graduating from school, but now many of them choose to live with their parents.

换句式可以避免换词的尴尬，比如 parents 换 father and mother 就尬的很

考官着急下班，只要讲的东西合情合理就可以了，没人会和你抬杠的，不会抠逻辑漏洞

### 开头第二句，观点

#### 套句（易）

观点都是套句，背下来上考场直接抄

* I think the benefits of this trend outweigh its drawbacks.
* I think this trend has both positive and negative outcomes.
* This phenomenon has some benefits, but its drawbacks should not be ignored.
* Although this phenomenon has some benefits, I am also concerned about its drawbacks.
* This trend has some benefits, though there are some problems that should not be ignored.
* This pattern has some benefits, although it may lead to some problems.

**写背景是原创，写观点是套句**

分数和开头没太大关系，主要决定于正文

#### 概括好处（难）

* This makes the process of shopping more convenient and enjoyable, although it may lead to some problems.
* This can make the process of shopping more convenient, but it causes a series of problems that should not be ignored.

## 总结

* 开头段的写作(背景+个人观点)
  * 背景句的写作技巧
    1. 针对题目的关键词引出话题
    2. 运用词汇替换和语法技巧(切换主语)
    3. 增补一些句子成分
       * 原因、结果、目的、对比、举例
       * 从句、并列、介词短语、动词不定式
* 观点句的写作技巧:
  1. 可以使用套
  2. 也可以把好处或者弊端具体化

开头审题5分钟，第7分钟就要写完

概括好处太费时间，容易写不完

考虑时间成本强烈建议用套句
