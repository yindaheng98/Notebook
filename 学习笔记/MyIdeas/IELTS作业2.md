* There is a common belief that advertisements are responsible for making people buy the same products and discouraging them from being unique.
* While I agree that advertisements have an impact on consumer choices, I do not believe that everyone loses their individuality because of it.

## 让步段

There is no doubt that advertisements have impacts on our decisions of buying which products. Since the lack of professional knowledge, it is difficult for consumers to distinguish ideal products from others, but only believe the advertisements. What's worse, advertisement providers even show their advertisement once and once again so that weaken consumers' abilities to find suitable products and make more people to buy same productios.

### 范句

* Undoubtedly, advertisements influence our purchasing decisions.
* As consumers, we often lack the expertise to differentiate between ideal products and others, which leads us to rely on advertisements. 
* Moreover, advertisers often bombard us with their messages repeatedly, which can weaken our abilities to make informed decisions and lead us to buy the same products as others.

## Disagree段1

However, which product bo people buy is not only defined by the advertisements. Obviously, people with different finanical conditions would not purchase same product for same purpose. For instance, not all people are willing to pay for the products in advertisements, and some people would like to spend their time to find cheaper products in a supermarket or mall. Advertisement is only one of the aspects that people consider when choose products, therefore cannot eliminate characteristics of individuals.

### 范句

However, I contend that advertisements are just one of several factors that influence consumer behavior. People have diverse financial backgrounds, and therefore not everyone will purchase the same products for the same purpose. For example, some may not be willing to pay for the products advertised and may choose to explore cheaper options at a supermarket or mall. Hence, advertisements cannot solely define the consumer choices and cannot eliminate the uniqueness of individuals.

## Disagree段2

Furthermore, advertisements itself are variable since products are variable. To earn more money, companies are encourage to invent different products and design different advertisements for their products. Therefore, there are lots of different advertisements for a variety of different products for people to choose, and there is no worry about loose characteristics.

### 范句

Furthermore, advertisements are not static, as products are continuously evolving. To attract more customers and increase revenue, companies frequently introduce new products and design new advertisements for them. As a result, people have a vast selection of various products and advertisements to choose from, thus maintaining their individuality.

## 结尾段

In conclusion, it is true that advertisements have impacts on people's decision of purchasing, but it is difficult to say such impacts would discourage them from being different individuals. People are making their decision on not only advertisements, but also many other aspects.

### 范句

In conclusion, while advertisements do have an impact on our purchasing decisions, I disagree that they discourage people from being unique individuals. People consider multiple factors while making decisions, and advertisements are just one of them. Ultimately, people's individuality depends on various personal, social, and cultural factors that go beyond the influence of advertisements.
