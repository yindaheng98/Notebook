#### 稿

I would like to talk about a person I know who often helps others, which is my classmate Mr. Wong. He is an experienced programmer who has a strong ability to solve problems and find information on the internet. Whenever our classmates have questions or difficulties with programming, Mr. Wong is always willing to help and share his knowledge. He is patient and clear in his explanations, and he never makes others feel stupid or inferior. What's more, Mr. Wong has a selfless and generous personality that always puts others first. This was particularly evident in a school project we worked on together, where we had to build a complex software program. Mr. Wong took on the responsibility of designing the structure and integrating the work of others, which was a challenging and time-consuming task. However, he did it with enthusiasm and dedication, always thinking about how his work could benefit the group as a whole. As a result, we not only produced an excellent software program, but also created a reusable structure that could be applied to future projects. This was a testament to Mr. Wong's leadership and teamwork skills, as well as his heart full of helping others. Thanks to his efforts, our group received the highest grade in the class and we all learned a lot from him. Overall, I think Mr. Wong is an outstanding person who embodies the spirit of helping others, and I feel lucky to have him as a friend and classmate.

#### 稿

When I was a child, I had a memorable experience of building a two-wheel car in a hand-working classroom. I used logo blocks and motors to construct the car, which required balance on two wheels. Although building the car was easy, programming it was difficult, especially since I was young and had limited knowledge of control theory. Fortunately, the teacher provided equations and functions for us to use in the program. We were thrilled to see the car move, even though it didn't perform as expected. We enjoyed adjusting the factors in the program to achieve balance, but unfortunately, I was unable to achieve balance. I didn't understand why at the time, but later in university, I learned that the motor I had chosen was designed for robots rather than boosting the wheel. It didn't have enough speed to achieve the factors I wrote in the program. This failure left a deep impression on me, but I was still happy at the time. This experience boosted my interest in machines and inspired me to pursue control theory as my career.
