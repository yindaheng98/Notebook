  * 甲方：全球化，慈善的宗旨，无国界，国家之间的贫富差距，发生战争，自然灾害，需要国际援助(如果只给自己，比较自私，违背了慈善的原则)
  * 乙方：资金不足，资源有限，力不从心；其他国家可能会依赖，穷人得不到，腐败
  * 结论：援助自已是合理的，但是如果有能力的话也应该去援助其他国家
* 题3: Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Others,however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. 剑9-3
  * 甲方：增加运动设施，更方便，鼓励锻炼，有地方
  * 乙方：搞了设施以后，只能吸引本身喜欢锻炼的人，而很多人没有兴趣，仍然不会去

### 甲方两段

运动员付出很多（为什么，怎么样，结果怎样）make great effort
* 训练辛苦 undergo strict training
* 容易受伤 be prone to injury, get seriously injured
* 退休很早 retire very early, short career
* 压力大 under huge pressure, bear high pressure, extremely stressful
* 为国争光 win honor for the nation, bring glory to the motherland

Those who advocate sports stars' high income believe that they have made a great effort 或扩展 and deserve this money.

Those who advocate sports stars' high income believe that they have made a great effort 或扩展 with many years of training and competition.

Famous athletes have to undergo strict training since they are very young.

They are prone to injury and retire very early, with great potential risk of injury in their short careers.

They bear extremely high pressure.
扩展
They bring glory to the nation but bear extremely high pressure in the competition.

介词如螺丝钉把关键词串起来

明星运动员收入主要来自广告（为什么，怎么样，结果怎样）
* 公司请运动员代言产品 endorse, advertise
* 明星影响力，知名度 influence, popularity
* 粉丝崇拜他们，购买 worship,adore
* 给厂家带来利润 bring huge profits
* 厂家付运动员很多钱 pay them a large sum of money

Also, *unlike* other occupations, the majority of athletes incomes come *from* advertisements. Many sports stars are invited to advertise branded products, from sportswear *to* household necessities. *Since* their popularity can significantly boost the sales of the products *and* generate huge profits for the manufacturers, *it* is reasonable for them to be paid a large amount of money.

### 乙方一段

However, some people argue that other professionals like doctors and scientists take more responsibilities and make greater contribution to society, but their salaries are much lower than sports stars' This is unfair, which may also lead to the wrong values: The whole society would place less value on other essential professions and people would be keen to pursue fame and fortune.
扩展
A good example is that many young people dream of becoming famous and making great fortune overnight, but cannot concentrate on academic study in school.

### 结尾

In my opinion, it seems justified for top athletes to earn high incomes because of their influence and popularity. However, there is no doubt that we should respect those important professions and make them well paid

## 题2: Some people believe that charitable organizations should give aid to people in the greatest need wherever they live, while others think charitable organizations should concentrate on helping people in their own country instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. 2010-1-9

### 开头

背景+观点
In the modern society a growing number of people have health problems due to their lifestyles. Some people suggest that the government should provide more sports facilities for people to do physical exercise. However, other people think that other measures can be more effective.

背景+套句
In the modern society many people's health is declining due to their lifestyles. Whether providing sports facilities can solve this problem is a controversial issue (a topic of debate).

### 甲方一段

增加运动设施，更方便，鼓励锻炼，有地方

对比论证：没有设施的时候，宅在家，打游戏，看电视，想锻炼，没地方，只能放弃

Build sports facilities is a good way to encourage people to do physical exercise regularly.
对比论证
People used to stay at home and lead sedentary lifestyles, choosing to watch TV and play video games in their spare time. They plan to go swimming or play football, but there are no swimming pools or playgrounds available in the neighborhood.
反着说回去
If there is easy access to sports facilities, people would be more likely to go downstairs and participate in sports activities on a daily basis.

### 乙方两段（反驳甲方）

However, interest in sports is not universal, and additional facilities might simply attract the already fit, not those who most need them. Perhaps we should take other measures to tackle people's health problems. As many diseases are caused by eating too much high-fat food, it is important to promote healthy diet among the general public. If people could consume less junk food, the incidence of relevant diseases such as obesity and diabetes would decline.

In addition, high tax could be imposed on tobacco and alcohol, as excessive consumption of these contributes to poor health. In some public places, smoking should be banned. Changing the habit of travelling could also benefit people's health. Walking or cycling for short-distance trip would be an effective way for exercising
