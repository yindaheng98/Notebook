# 徐卫雅思句型课仿写作业一

手机似乎成为了学生生活中不可缺少的一部分

Smart phone has become a necessary part in students' life.

纠错
* Smart phone? 应该有The
* part in? 应该是part of!
* students' life? 应该是student's life 或者students' lives! 单复数要统一！

扩展

The smart phone has become a necessary part of students' lives, **both in school and at home**.

网络社交工具使人与人之间的沟通变得更加方便了

The social media has make the communication between people much more convenient.

纠错
* The social media不需要The，因为social media不是一个具体的事物
* has make应该是has made，make的过去分词是made
* make the communication不需要the，因为communication不是一个具体的事物
* more convenient比较应该有对象，需要加than before

扩展

Communication between people has become more convenient than before, with various kinds of social networking tools available.

People can use social networking tools to communicate conveniently, without worrying about distance or cost.
