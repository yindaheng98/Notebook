### 话题分类准备

#### 教育

* 问：Your university is organizing a series of guest lectures. Some people think that speakers with controversial opinions should not be invited to speak at the university.

    * express opinions
    * scientific progress
  * 总：不能限制演讲内容
* 答：
  * 总：I think speakers with controversial opinions should not be prevented from speaking at university. 
  * 分：Universities are **places for open debate**. Students should receive opinions from different directions, which can help them develop **critical thinking** skills in the debates. 
  * 分：Also, universities have a responsibility to **promote free speech** and **academic freedom**. If not, they risk **becoming echo chambers**, and only certain opinions are allowed to be expressed, which is not good for scientific progress. 
  * 总：So universities should not limit the speakers to expressing their opinions.

* 问：Some professors allow students who have not done well on graded assignments during a course to do additional assignments in order to improve their overall course grade. Do you think this is a good idea?
* 纲：
  * 总：表明观点
  * 分：促进学生学习
    * filter the students
    * stimulate their understanding of the knowledge
    * comprehend the course content
    * encourage them to gain a better understanding
  * 分：成绩不好不代表学的不好
    * doesn't necessarily imply
    * lacks comprehension of the course material
    * demonstrate their understanding
* 答：
  * 总：I think this is a good idea. 
  * 分：The aim of assignments should not be to **filter the students** but to **stimulate their understanding of the knowledge**. Students who receive low grades may not fully **comprehend the course content**. Therefore, providing additional assignments can be a way to **encourage them to gain a better understanding** of the material. 
  * 分：Besides, a **low grade doesn't necessarily imply that the student lacks comprehension** of the course material. They may only not feel well during the exam or have other issues. Additional assignments can **demonstrate their understanding** of the course material.

* 问：Some people think that schools should assign projects and other work for students to complete over vacation before the beginning of the school year. Others think that schoolwork should only be assigned during the actual academic year. Which opinion do you agree with?

  * 总：可以使学生准备好新学期
    * well-prepared for the incoming term
* 答：
  * 总：I think assigning projects for students to complete over vacation is a good idea. 
  * 分：First, assigned projects during the vacation would encourage students to **comprehend the course content** before the new term begins, which would help them **learn more effectively** in the incoming term. 
  * 分：Second, when students are given tasks to complete during their vacation time, they are more likely to stay engaged with their academic work and keep their minds active. 
  * 总：Therefore, assigning projects on vacation would make students **well-prepared for the incoming term**, so it is a good idea.

  * 分：Another reason is that I believe solving the problem by ourselves in schoolwork is the way to comprehend the course content. Our professor should know that and take time to design the schoolwork. In my case, most of the problems can be solved by discussing with classmates, and this discussion promoted my understanding of the knowledge.

The men agree with the opinion since

At first, he thinks this is a waste of money. He thinks the money should be used for more valuable projects. He mentioned a library project that stuck for a long time, which disappointed him and his friends.

Second, he thinks this is not good for the sky environment. It will bother the telescope that sees the star in the sky. This is related to an astronomy project, without this they can only see the stars in the textbook.

##### 范例

In the reading, the student proposes that the university should prohibit students from playing sports on the dining hall lawn because this will make the grass look nicer and instead, students can use the field next to the gym as a substitute. In the listening, the woman totally disagrees with this proposal because she thinks that the students who play sports aren’t the ones who are responsible. In fact, everybody crosses the lawn every day since it is centrally located. And they don't even bother walking on the sidewalks because usually people are in a hurry to get to class. On top of that, the substitute is not very good since in order to use that, students need to walk for a long distance. But actually, sometimes they just want to have a little fun in between classes. So they will not bother going that far.

##### 范例

In the reading, the University announces that students who are going to graduate will be able to use a new degree Navigator website to keep track of their requirements because this will make it easier for them to check the progress online and at the same time reduce the workload for academic advisers. In the listening, the man totally agrees with the announcement, because he says that students need to deal with a lot of classes for degree programs and it's easy for them to make a mess. Sometimes they even miss particular courses just like his friend whose graduation was delayed just because he didn't realize that he hadn't finished his history degree. Also, he thinks that the advisers who are mostly professors are really busy working, so this website will free them from redundant tasks and have more time to focus on serious things, like switching a major or doing internships.

The lecture is about the factors that affect the population of species. The professor gave two examples to indicate how biotic and abiotic factors affect the population.

The first is about mase and awes. Mase is eaten by the awes, so when the population of awes increases, the population of Mase will drop.

The second is about the rabbit and winter. Since rabbits will reproduce in the spring, if the winter is short, rabbits will begin reproduction earlier, so the population will increase.

##### 改进

The lecture is about the factors that affect the population of species. The professor gave two examples to indicate how biotic and abiotic factors affect the population.

The first is about mise and owls. Mise is eaten by the owls, so the number of mice depends upon the number of owls. When the population of owls increases, the population of mise will drop.

The second is about the rabbit and winter. Rabbits have their young at the end of the winter and keep reproducing until the next winter. So if there is a year that winter is short, the rabbits will start reproducing earlier and reproduce more rabbits.

The agonistic behavior is that when animals have conflict on food, they will participate in a competition and show their strength, without harming each other.

The professor takes rattlesnakes as example. When two rattlesnakes found the same hole, and both of them want to own it, they will make their body seen as tall as possible and push each other, but they will not bite each other. When one pushes the other rattlesnake to the ground, it will just release the other.

The professor introduced two ways to prevent food from spoil. 

The first is about temperature. Foods get spoiled mainly because of bacteria. When the temperature is low, bacteria will grow slower. The professor takes fish as the example. When fish is frozen, it will last long, because bacteria grow slowly in low temperature. 

The second is about moisture. Moisture is important to the growth of bacteria, bacteria cannot grow without it. The professor takes milk as example. Power milk last longer than liquid milk. Since the moisture is removed, bacteria cannot grow.
