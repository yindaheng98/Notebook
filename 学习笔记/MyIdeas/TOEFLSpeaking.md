### 话题分类准备

#### 教育

* 问：Your university is organizing a series of guest lectures. Some people think that speakers with controversial opinions should not be invited to speak at the university. Others believe that the university should feature a variety of speakers, regardless of their opinions. Which point of view do you agree with? Explain why, using details and examples in your response.
* 纲：
  * 总：表明观点
  * 分：促进批判性思维
    * places for open debate
    * receive opinions from different directions
    * develop critical thinking
  * 分：维护学术自由
    * promote free speech
    * academic freedom
    * becoming echo chambers
    * express opinions
    * scientific progress
  * 总：不能限制演讲内容
* 答：
  * 总：I think speakers with controversial opinions should not be prevented from speaking at university. 
  * 分：Universities are **places for open debate**. Students should receive opinions from different directions, which can help them develop **critical thinking** skills in the debates. 
  * 分：Also, universities have a responsibility to **promote free speech** and **academic freedom**. If not, they risk **becoming echo chambers**, and only certain opinions are allowed to be expressed, which is not good for scientific progress. 
  * 总：So universities should not limit the speakers to expressing their opinions.

* 问：Some professors allow students who have not done well on graded assignments during a course to do additional assignments in order to improve their overall course grade. Do you think this is a good idea?
* 纲：
  * 总：表明观点
  * 分：促进学生学习
    * filter the students
    * stimulate their understanding of the knowledge
    * comprehend the course content
    * encourage them to gain a better understanding
  * 分：成绩不好不代表学的不好
    * doesn't necessarily imply
    * lacks comprehension of the course material
    * demonstrate their understanding
* 答：
  * 总：I think this is a good idea. 
  * 分：The aim of assignments should not be to **filter the students** but to **stimulate their understanding of the knowledge**. Students who receive low grades may not fully **comprehend the course content**. Therefore, providing additional assignments can be a way to **encourage them to gain a better understanding** of the material. 
  * 分：Besides, a **low grade doesn't necessarily imply that the student lacks comprehension** of the course material. They may only not feel well during the exam or have other issues. Additional assignments can **demonstrate their understanding** of the course material.

* 问：Some people think that schools should assign projects and other work for students to complete over vacation before the beginning of the school year. Others think that schoolwork should only be assigned during the actual academic year. Which opinion do you agree with?
* 纲：
  * 总：表明观点
  * 分：提前熟悉内容
    * comprehend the course content
    * learn more effectively
  * 分：保持学习状态
    * stay engaged with academic work
    * keep minds active
  * 总：可以使学生准备好新学期
    * well-prepared for the incoming term
* 答：
  * 总：I think assigning projects for students to complete over vacation is a good idea. 
  * 分：First, assigned projects during the vacation would encourage students to **comprehend the course content** before the new term begins, which would help them **learn more effectively** in the incoming term. 
  * 分：Second, when students are given tasks to complete during their vacation time, they are more likely to stay engaged with their academic work and keep their minds active. 
  * 总：Therefore, assigning projects on vacation would make students **well-prepared for the incoming term**, so it is a good idea.

* 问：When you have problems with schoolwork, would you ask for help or favor from your friends who have the relevant information/knowledge or professional tutors?
* 纲：
  * 总：表明观点
  * 分：教授不容易见到，同学容易见到
    * make an appointment
    * meet at his or her office time
  * 分：自己解决问题才叫学习，大部分问题都能解决
    * way to comprehend the course content
    * discussion promoted my understanding of the knowledge
* 答：
  * 总：I will first discuss this with my friends.
  * 分：Most importantly, it is much easier to meet my friends than meet our professor. I can meet my friends every day, but for the professor, I should make an appointment and can only meet at his or her office time. You know, professors are busy and difficult to meet.
  * 分：Another reason is that I believe solving the problem by ourselves in schoolwork is the way to comprehend the course content. Our professor should know that and take time to design the schoolwork. In my case, most of the problems can be solved by discussing with classmates, and this discussion promoted my understanding of the knowledge.

* 问：It is necessary to have a good teacher for students to learn new knowledge and skills.
* 纲：
  * 总：表明观点
  * 分：好老师对知识的理解更加深入，从而帮助学生学得更快
    * deeper insight into the knowledge
    * help students learn more effectively
  * 分：好老师有更好的经验，有书本上学不到的知识，用工科举例，用反面填充细节
    * learning by themselves in practice
