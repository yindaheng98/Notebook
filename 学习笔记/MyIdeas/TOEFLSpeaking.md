### 话题分类准备

#### 教育

* 问：Your university is organizing a series of guest lectures. Some people think that speakers with controversial opinions should not be invited to speak at the university. Others believe that the university should feature a variety of speakers, regardless of their opinions. Which point of view do you agree with? Explain why, using details and examples in your response.
* 答：I think speakers with controversial opinions should not be prevented from speaking at university. Universities are **places for open debate**. Students should receive opinions from different directions, which can help them develop **critical thinking** skills in the debates. Also, universities have a responsibility to **promote free speech** and **academic freedom**. If not, they risk **becoming echo chambers**, and only certain opinions are allowed to be expressed. So universities should not limit the speakers to expressing their opinions.

* 问：Some professors allow students who have not done well on graded assignments during a course to do additional assignments in order to improve their overall course grade. Do you think this is a good idea?
* 答：I think this is a good idea. The aim of assignments should not be to **screen the students** but to **stimulate their understanding of the knowledge**. Students who receive low grades may not fully **comprehend the course content**. Therefore, providing additional assignments can be a way to **encourage them to gain a better understanding** of the material. Besides, a **low grade doesn't necessarily imply that the student lacks comprehension** of the course material. They may only not feel well during the exam or have other issues. Additional assignments can **demonstrate their understanding** of the course material.
